The program currently consists of the following modules:
schubert, grothendieck.

These modules are structured as follows:

-schubert.py defines the Grassmannian class
and the various methods and object variables associated to it.

-grothendieck.py contains the necessary functions for calculating the product of
an arbitrary schubert class with a special schubert class.  most of the methods
take a Grassmannian object as one of the arguments.  currently this module
also contains functions for calculating equivariant Pieri coefficients in type B/C,
although these will be moved to their own module soon.
